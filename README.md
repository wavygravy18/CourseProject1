# CourseProject1
This repo contains a r script called run_analysis.R, a README.md, and a code book.

To use the r script “run_analysis.R” to create the file “dataset.txt”, you must download and unzip the UCI HAR Dataset and set your working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder. It can be downloaded from “https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip” and more information about the dataset can be found at “http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones”.

After running “run_analysis.R”, you can read the data into R using “read.table("./dataset.txt", header=TRUE)” without the starting and ending quotes.

More detailed information about the project including the descriptions of the data as well as the actual data that was used to create dataset.txt is provided in files in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
